To run the app locally, you'll need to install all the dependencies from the `package.json` file. Use the command `npm install` to install all dependencies. Once the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the app locally at `localhost:3000`.

To start the backend server, navigate to the `backend` folder and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the backend server at `localhost:5000`.

## Summary

By following all the steps and ensuring you have the prerequisites, you:

- Deployed the app locally with all necessary dependencies.
- Can make calls to the backend and handle the responses.
- Should be able to read your text with ease.
